# Schwab-API-Python 
This is an unofficial python program to access the Schwab api.    
You will need a Schwab developer account [here](https://beta-developer.schwab.com/).

## Quick setup
1. Create a new Schwab individual developer app with callback url "https://127.0.0.1" (case sensitive) and wait until the status is "Ready for use", note that "Approved - Pending" will not work.
2. Enable TOS (Thinkorswim) for your Schwab account, it is needed for orders and other api calls.
3. Python version 3.11 or higher is required.     
4. `mamba env create -f schwab_api_env.yml && mamba activate schwab_api` 
5. Paste keys in the `.env` file specifically appKey and appSecret.
6. Start by running the main.py file.

## What can this program do?
 - Authenticate and access the api (`api.initialize()`)
 - Functions for all api functions (examples in `main.py`)
 - Auto "access token" updates (`api.updateTokensAutomatic()`)
 - Stream real-time data (`stream.startManual()`)
 - Automatically start/stop stream (`stream.startAutomatic()`)
 ### TBD 
 - Automatic refresh token updates. (Waiting for Schwab implementation)
 - Customizable stream response handler. (Waiting for Schwab implementation)


## Usage and Design
This python client makes working with the TD/Schwab api easier.    
The idea is to make an easy to understand, organized, and highly-automatic interface for the api.   
Below is a light documentation on how it works, python is pseudocode-esk so if you are confused just read the code and follow the functions. 

### Organization

The root of the wrapper:
 - `main.py` where the main program is run from, contains examples for you to get started with.
 - `.env` contains the app key and app secret, these need to be filled in.
 - `tokens.json` contains api tokens as well as dates for when they expire.

The modules folder contains code for main operations:     
 - `api.py` contains functions relating to api calls, requests, and automatic token checker threads.
 - `stream.py` contains functions for streaming data from websockets.
 - `terminal.py` contains a program for making additional terminal windows and printing to the terminal with color.

<!---
### Initialization
main.py initializes below main() in `if __name__ == '__main__':` each call is described below:
 1. `api.initialize()` # This calls a function that checks if the access or refresh token need to be re-authenticated. It also adds the tokens and expire times to variables in `universe.py`
 2. `main()` # This is where you put your code to be run.
